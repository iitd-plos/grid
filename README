Running
=======

For killing all programs on all xorav nodes, use killall_grid.py

use restart_grid.py to killall and restart grid

For striping the jobs to multiple files and running each file on a separate node, use stripe_jobs.py

Installing
==========
See install.sh for installing

Noticed that upgrading to celery-4+ was required to get it to work. Also, 'pip install Celery' installs in /usr/local/bin/celery, which co-exists with /usr/bin/celery, so need to specify full path

----

If rabbitmq stops working, do this:

service stop rabbitmq
ps aux | grep epmd
ps aux | grep erl

kill both these types of processes
